# tweety

Tweety is a guessing game where players try to identify the author of a tweet. Players can select a group of authors to chose from, including famous actors, musicians, comedians and politicians.

Tweety was thought up created by Shawn Wilkinson and Mari Galicer during week six of Dev Bootcamp's intensive full-stack web development training program. It was built using Ruby, Sinatra, Materialize and the Twitter Search API.
